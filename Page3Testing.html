                Testing of the jars was more complicated than imagined, the first problem that was encountered was, distribution of the jars
            </p>
            <p>
                their sloution was to release the test jars in waves, each wave had a specific domain and server asigned to it, if the domain were to go down, it would act like a kill switch and disable all of the corresponding jars!
            </p>
            <p>
                the second problem was choosing the play testers, unlike extension 16.05, applying for tests was public for each wave! , for each play tester a number of exams were chosen to identify their psychological behaviors so they could identify who would leak the tests first!
