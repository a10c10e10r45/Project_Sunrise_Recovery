            the "webcrawler" was a network bot made for detecting
            unregistered copies of the game being redistributed from the web,
        </p>
        <p>
            the webcrawler is so powerful that, you cant even send unregistered jars in internet
            chat apps!
        </p>
        <p>
            But, you can get a license, when you get a license you will be given a code,
            you need to embed that code in the last line in your website as a comment,
            so the webcrawler detects it and doesn't revoke that jar!
